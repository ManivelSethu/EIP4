** Convolution: **   
operation to get the similarity details with respect to the kernel or filter, from the area of focus in the input

** Filters/Kernels: **
elemental information extractor to construct next level of details

** Epoch : **
1 cycle of going through the whole data set. 

**1x1 Convolution :**
Operation to manipulate the channels (reduce or increase) by mixing contextually related features. 

** 3x3 Convolution :**
filter to extract information (same as filter/kernels)

** Feature Maps : **
elemental parts of an image (or an entity) is called features. Extracted set of a particular feature is called feature map. 

** Activation Function: **
(not understood from session 1) 

** Receptive Field :**
Area of focus in an image  in terms of number pixel to represent the information in the input (global receptive field)
or the layer before (local receptive field)
